                    My name is Bahman Soltani.<br /><br />
                    I was originally born in Esfahan, Iran. Currently, I'm a student in Berlin studying for a Master of Computer Science at IU International University of Applied Science.
                    In Iran, I was working as a developer with different CRM and EPR systems for about 10 years. My biggest passion is programming
                    and learning new development technologies.
                    <br /><br />
                    For my undergraduate studies I studied first at the Azad University of Khomeinishahr for an Associate Degree in Computer Science from January 2007 to June 2010 and then
                    for Bachelor in Software Engineering I studied at Azad University of Najafabad from January 2011 to April 2014. After graduating with my Associate's Degree in Computer Science, I  started to work as a Desktop Developer at
                    Khatsaz Company and used my knowledge for developing a desktop version of their administrable systems including accounting, management, and warehouse. After finishing their project, I joined Varanegar company's developers' team
                    to work on both windows and web applications. Then after almost two years, I joined back Khatsaz company's IT Department to upgrade their administrative application from windows to a web version for their offices in different cities.
                    After my successful graduation with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I decided to continue working on software development using the knowledge I achieved at university,
                    so here is a summary of my work experience and the technologies I worked with:
