                    My name is Bahman Soltani.<br /><br />
                    I was originally born in Esfahan, Iran. Currently, I'm a student in Berlin studying for a Master of Computer Science at IU International University of Applied Science.
                    In Iran, I was working as a full-stack developer with different CRM and EPR systems for 10 years.
                    <br /><br />
                    I have extensive experience in C# and SQL Server that I gained through 10 years of working as a software developer.
                    From December 2017 to August 2020, I worked as a full stack developer and the head of the project at Khatsaz Company
                    to implement a web application by inheriting their desktop version, which was done by me in my previous job at the very company,
                    of the warehouse management, accounting, and administrative application. Before that, from June 2016 to November 2017,
                    at Varanegar Pishro Company where I worked as a full stack web developer completing a web-based application for reviewing the completed jobs in different departments
                    for distribution companies, including accounting, stock, sales, and account management departments, and then as a full-stack desktop developer,
                    I implemented a desktop version based on the web version. After that, in another team, as a full stack developer
                    I worked to implement a desktop-based application for administrating and monitoring the process of the workflows for the distribution delivery system.
                    Then I joined a bigger team to implement a desktop-based administrating application for discount and reward management
                    for the accounting department of the central distribution system. And before that, from January 2010 to March 2016
                    I worked as a full-stack developer at Khatsaz Company to implement a desktop application
                    for their warehouse management, accounting, human resources, and other administrative tools.
                    By achieving my Associate Degree I started to work as a full-stack developer,
                    meanwhile, during my work there, I completed my Bachelor of Science Degree in Software Engineering,
                    and after finishing the project at Khatsaz, I joined Varanegar Pishro where I worked as both web and desktop developer,
                    for implementation new applications or further development and integration of older processes,
                    I was responsible to follow various tasks defined on Jira based on Agile method
                    by the project manager, project supervisor, database administrator, customer service, and their clients.
                    I was also allowed to write SQL programming queries such as store procedures and functions for database administrator for the primary database.
                    After almost two years, Khatsaz Company asked me to implement a web application by inheriting their desktop version of the warehouse management, accounting, and administrative application for their new offices in different cities in Iran,
                    so here is a summary of my work experience and the technologies I worked with:
